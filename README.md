Project's Purpose or Goal: An internal software/web application to keep track of bugs; similar to an issue tracking system  

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

    Assign bug tickets to technical support user accounts

    Have a ticket form to enter (a) date, (b) bug severity, (c) bug behavior, (d) how to reproduce the bug, and redirect user to confirmation page after submitting 

    User authentication + Admin management page

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

    Ruby/Rails: Utilize the scaffolding tools of Ruby/Rails to quickly implement an MVC, and Devise for user authentication

    PostgreSQL: Database to hold all the information

    Heroku: A host to deploy my website

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

    CRUD functionality: The MVP is adding and reading bugs. The next features are to delete and update the tickets.

    Implement a chat function or message system so that users can interact with each other about the bugs in real-time or with timestamps

    Have admins see a chart/graph for overall metrics of employees utilizing Chart.js

    After tickets are closed, emails are sent to the user to confirm it’s fixed. Other emails would be sent to workers if they’re assigned a new ticket to work on.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

    React: For better user interface integration 

    AWS (Stretch goal): To upload and host images for workers’ bug

    Unsure what APIs to implement to make this project more efficient, but I’ll be on the lookout for chat functions/message system APIs for now if there are any
